I aim to create a generalized and scalable version of the main objective -- To find the best latency for a connected node with a needed key.  
To do this, I am attempting to abstract my project to a level of IPs without having to worry about the intricacies of PCI and Ethernet addresses. Without this generalization, it's pretty inevitable that my project would not be compatible with certain network configurations.  
Test focuses on sending to local nodes while Test2 focuses on sending to foreign nodes (e.g. Wiscounsin to Clemson). The current difficulty is that interfaces can not be used to send packets to and from nodes with differing geographical locations, hence why I aim to send to IPs and ditch the needed usage of interfaces.
